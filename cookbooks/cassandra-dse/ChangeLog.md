## Changes Between 3.5.0 and 4.0.0

`4.0.0` has **breaking changes in attribute structure**.

### Node Config Attributes Moved

Node configuration attributes are now under `node['cassandra']['config']`. Since
there are many of them, please [consult the default attributes file](https://github.com/michaelklishin/cassandra-chef-cookbook/blob/master/attributes/config.rb).

### SHA 256 Checksums

SHA256 is now used instead of MD5 for checksums. The cookbook
now provides checksums for Cassandra versions up to 2.2.0.

### 2.2.0 by Default

The cookbook now provisions Cassandra 2.2.0 by default.


## Changes Between 3.4.0 and 3.5.0

### Seed Discovery Using Chef Search

The cookbook will now use Chef search to discover seed nodes.
The exact query used is configurable. Search is disabled by default.

GH issues: [#204](https://github.com/michaelklishin/cassandra-chef-cookbook/issues/204),
[#205](https://github.com/michaelklishin/cassandra-chef-cookbook/pull/205).

The following node attribute snippet enables Chef search and will list
IP addresses of nodes with roles `cassandra` and `cassandra-seed`:

``` json
  "cassandra": {
    "seed_discovery": {
      "use_chef_search": true,
      "search_query": "role:cassandra-seed OR role:cassandra"
    }
  }
```


### `:data_dir` Array Handling

`cassandra-dse::tarball` now handles arrays of data dirs.

GH issue: [#154](https://github.com/michaelklishin/cassandra-chef-cookbook/issues/154).



## Changes Between 3.3.0 and 3.4.0

set to the `node[:cassandra][:limits][:nofile]` value.
